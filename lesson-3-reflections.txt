When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When one collaborates with other people in a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it was an automatic pull from GitHub I could not have the overview any more
since I would be swamped with project updates from my colleagues commiting
their work on GitHub

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.
When would you use one instead of another?

forks can only exist within GitHub. They are clones in GitHub. Clones are
copies for everything else, e.g. copies from GitHub to the local repository
or copies within the local directory. branches are always within the same
repository they are modifications, which have the same parent.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally

It allows to work offline or to explore the things that other people did
on GitHub before merging it with my stuff.
