When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When one collaborates with other people in a project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If it was an automatic pull from GitHub I could not have the overview any more
since I would be swamped with project updates from my colleagues commiting
their work on GitHub
